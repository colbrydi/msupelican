Title: Making an academic publications page
Date: 2017-06-01

For an academic website, publications are often useful.  This post describes a process for adding publications to your pelican website using pelican. You can view the page generated using this post here:

[Publications](./pages/publications)

# Step 1: Generate bibtex file

First you need a bibtex file.  This tutorial has only been tested with bibtex files generated by [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).  

- In zotero, make a folder and add all references that you would like to see in your publications page.  
- Right-click on the folder and select ```Export Collection...```.  Pick the "Bibtex" option and save your file with the ```bib2html/publications.bib``` filename.

# Step 2: Run the bib2html command

Next you need to run the bib2html command to generate the basic html file.  The provided makefile has a shortcut:

```make bib```

This will generate the ```content/pages/publications.html``` file.  

# Step 3: Run the ```make html``` command as before
Now that we have an a publications.html file we can run the ```make html``` command to add the pelican template components.

```make html```

# Final Notes
This part of the tutorial is a work in progress. If you change your bib file you have to repeat the steps above. Here are some things to consider:

- Bibliogrphy entries must have **author, title and year (or date)*** to work.
- Everytime you change the publications.bib file you need to run the ```make bib``` command.
