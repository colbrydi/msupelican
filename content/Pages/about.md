![Sparty]({filename}../images/sparty.gif){width=240}

Sparty grew up somewhere near Rome or Greece, I think, but in the last 200 years has moved to East Lansing to forge a new lifestyle. Hanging up his armor and weapons, he has decided to start a new career in academics and college sports, for the greatest university in the world - Michigan State.

Unbeknownst to most, Sparty is also an entrepreneur. He has multiple cafes across MSU campus, and rakes in a number of dollars and cents every year. That number is information that I do not have.

Although he has accomplished much, Sparty has big goals for the future. At the top of the list he hopes to trump his greatest rival - a wolverine named Brutus (two birds). He also has big plans to develop the newly formed [Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering (CMSE)](https://cmse.msu.edu/) Department and watch it flourish to be unanimously ranked #1 in the universe.
